<h2>Lure Fishing</h2>
  <p>Lure fishing for bass is all about searching out likely bass feeding grounds 
    and targeting them with your lures. It is an active and exciting way to fish, 
    often involving spectacular takes in shallow water.</p>
  <p>This type of fishing involves a lot of casting and moving, so think light: 
    a 9 to 10 foot (2.75 to 3 metre) spinning rod 
    with a fast action and casting weights of about 1&ndash;2 oz (20 to 50 grams), 
    paired with a medium-sized (5,000) fixed spool reel 
    loaded with 20 to 30 lb (8 to 14 kg) mono or braid (depending on your preference) 
    would be a typical set up.</p>
  <p>If you're the kind of angler who can't resist beautiful, shiny lures, 
    then bass angling is for you. The huge variety of hard lures used for bass includes 
    poppers and surface plugs, sub&#8209;surface lures and spinners. Soft plastics are also used, 
    such as paddletails, shads, sandeels and rubber worms. Given that bass marks are often weedy,
    these kinds of lures are best rigged weedless&hairsp;&mdash;&hairsp;rigged on a wide&#8209;gape hook 
    with the point buried in or flush with the lure to avoid snagging.on </p>
  <p>When spinning for bass, work the lures around 
    rocks, weedy cover and rough ground to seek out bass. Try varying the rate of retrieve until 
    you find a rhythm that works, and keep working the lures with the rod tip to give them a little life.
    Cover your target fishing area by casting in an arc around it from left&#8209;to&#8209;right, or vice versa. 
    Lastly, remember that bass are found in shallow water very close to the shore, often within 30 metres, 
    so you don't need to cast long distances all the time. An inquisitive bass will follow the lure right 
    to your boots, so don't rush to lift the lure from the water.</p>

    <h2>Fly Fishing</h2>
    <p>Fly fishing is a very sporting way of catching bass on light tackle, 
      and this technique has been growing in popularity in recent years.
      A typical saltwater fly rod is about 9 foot long (2.75 metres),
      with a rod weight of 8-10, with a salt&#8209;proof reel. The line should be 
      suitable for saltwater use, and weight&#8209;forward floating or slow&#8209;sinking 
      line is usually used.</p>
    <p>The venerable fly&#8209;fishing rule of &ldquo;matching-the-hatch&rdquo; applies 
      to saltwater fly&#8209;fishing too. Saltwater flies that are large 
      and imitate small fish, such as sandeel or sprat, work well for bass. 
      Some of the recommended patterns are Clousers, Surf Candies, 
      Crazy Charlies and Deceivers.</p>
    <p>Building your casting skills is important if you want to try saltwater fly-fishing. 
      The key to success is not having all the &ldquo;right gear&rdquo;; 
      there is no substitute for spending time on the water casting 
      and having a go at this exciting branch of fly fishing for yourself. 
      A bonus is that saltwater fly-fishing tackle used for bass can also 
      be used to fish for pollack, or even for pike on inland waters.</p>

    <h2>Bait Fishing</h2>
    <p>With bait fishing, the aim is to find a likely bass foraging ground 
      and let the bass find your bait with their good sense of smell. 
      Bass are voracious, aggressive feeders with quite large mouths, 
      so they will happily take relatively larger baits than most other species. 
      It is better to use natural bait that is in good condition 
      and as fresh as possible. The following bait are popular options when 
      fishing for bass:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Peeler crab (perhaps the best)</li>
        <li>Large prawns or shrimps</li>
        <li>Razor clam</li>
        <li>Sand eel</li>
        <li>Squid</li>
        <li>Mackerel strip</li>
        <li>Ragworm</li>
      </ul>
    <p>When fishing in estuaries or over intertidal flats with a good mix of rocky, weedy ground,
      aim to present your bait on a running ledger on a patch of sand or mud between rocks where bass will find it.
      Float fishing close to the sheltered side of a headland over rocks and ledges is also worth a try. 
      When beachcasting for bass, the usual practice is to fish the tide&hairsp;&mdash;&hairsp;start 
      at low-water and fish before the rising tide. Baits are usually cast on running ledgers into the 
      calm water just behind the breaking waves.</p>
