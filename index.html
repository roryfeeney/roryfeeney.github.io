    <h2>Why Bass?</h2>
    <p>The bass is one of the most exciting sport fish targeted by sea anglers in Ireland. 
      A challenging species to find and catch, these big, powerful predators can grown to several kilograms in weight.
      Bass put up a strong fight and can make long, clean runs, 
      giving the lucky anglers who catch these superb 
      &ldquo;bars of silver&rdquo; a great angling experience.

    <h2>Did You Know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Bass Biology</h2>
      <ul class="list-pad">
        <li>Bass (<em>Dicentrarchus labrax</em>) spawn off-shore. The pelagic larvae drift inshore to settle along the coast.</li>
        <li>Young bass live in estuaries for about four years before they move to open waters</li>
        <li>Bass are a relatively slow growing fish. A 40cm bass may be aged between 6 and 10 years old.</li>
        <li>Bass are a long-lived fish, and they may survive for up to 20 years.</li>
        <li>Bass are migratory. In summer, adult bass hunt close to shore along the coast, and in winter, they migrate off-shore.</li>

    <h2>Interested in Citizen Science?</h2>
    <p>Did you know that anglers can contribute valuable help to
      fishery scientists working on bass conservation? 
      Research for bass conservation depends on citizen science: 
      the collection of data by members of the public 
      in collaboration with scientists.</p>
      <p>Bass anglers can add an extra dimension to their sport 
      and help bass conservation research by collecting scale samples for analysis or 
      by tagging bass for tracking studies.</p>
