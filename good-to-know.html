    <h2>A Note On Fish Handling &amp; Safety</h2>
    <p>Bass are a tough fish covered with heavy, rough scales; 
      a bony gill cover with sharp edges and spikes; and
      strong, sharp spikes in the first dorsal fin. 
      Handle them with care! Their teeth are tiny, however, 
      so a good way to grip bass is gently by the mouth and by the tail, 
      or supporting the belly. 
      Check out these guidelines on how to catch-and-release fish.

        </ul>
    <p>Angling has very positive benefits for physical and mental
      health and well&#8209;being, but as with all water sports, 
      it is important to remember to stay safe around water. 
      When angling, wear appropriate clothing and footwear, such as warm layers 
      appropriate for the weather, a waterproof jacket, and strong boots 
      when fishing from rocks. 
      Remember to keep an eye on the tide and weather, and consider 
      learning lifesaving skills and investing in a lifejacket.
      Check out these detailed guidelines from Irish Water Safety:</p>

    <h2>Bass Angling Regulations</h2>
      <p>From the mid-1970s, bass stocks declined. Recognising that bass is an 
        economically important recreational species that is vulnerable to exploitation 
        due to its slow-growing, long-lived life cycle, Ireland introduced 
        a ban on commercial fishing and regulations for recreational bass angling in 1990.</p>
      <p>Bass remains the only marine species managed exclusively for recreational 
        angling in Irish waters. Irish bass angling regulations were recently revised 
        to accomodate new EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council Regulations. 
        The following regulations currently apply to recreational bass angling in Ireland:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A license is not required to fish in the sea for bass.</li>
        <li>There is no longer a closed season for bass angling.</li>
        <li>From January 1st 2018, <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">only catch-and-release</span> angling is permitted for bass.</li>
        <li>It is prohibited to take and kill any bass caught in Irish waters.</li>
      </ul>

<h2>Guides</h2>
  <p>Ireland's conservation of bass for recreational angling has 
    encouraged its recognition as a premier bass angling destination 
    and the development of professional guiding services, especially in the Southeast. 
    If you are completely new to bass fishing but keen to learn more quickly, it is worth 
    considering hiring a guide for a session. A good guide will get you started 
    with advice on tackle, provide tuition on techniques, take you to a good bass venue 
    and help you catch that first magic bar of silver.</p>
  <p>Inland Fisheries Ireland maintains lists of guides 
    and their contact details:</p>

    <h2>Sea Angling Clubs &amp; Competitions</h2>
    <p>The Irish Federation of Sea Anglers (IFSA) is the national umbrella organisation 
      for sea angling clubs in Ireland. They promote the sport of sea angling by 
      organising competitions, supporting international angling teams 
      representing Ireland and running programmes to encourage young people 
      to try sea angling.</p>
    <p>Joining a local sea angling club is a great way to meet fellow anglers, 
      learn more about fishing in your area and get involved in angling 
      meet-ups, trips and competitons. If you want to really get into bass angling,
      try taking part in a competition, such as the Irish Bass Festival, 
      held annually in July in the Southeast.</p>
